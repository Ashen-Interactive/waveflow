# Waveflow

**Waveflow** is a highly customizable, recursive Wave Function Collapse (WFC) tool written in Rust. It generates tileable grayscale heightmaps using rules defined in structured `.yaml` files, which can then be converted into 3D terrain meshes for use in game development, grayboxing, and procedural world generation.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ⚙️ **Fully customizable tile rules** via YAML
- 🔁 **Recursive field division** — define sectors that contain sub-sectors, down to the pixel level
- 🧱 Supports hierarchical field types (e.g., stone, water, mud, concrete)
- 📏 Output resolution defined by user (`X × X` tiles)
- 🌐 Ideal for prototyping levels, terrain, or custom biome structures
- 📄 Easy-to-understand config format
- 💡 Designed for extensibility (new field types, collapse rules, etc.)

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user chooses an output resolution (e.g., `128 × 128`).
2. A YAML file defines the **initial fields**, their sizes, and recursive sub-structure.
3. Each field can:
   - Contain other fields
   - Define probabilities, constraints, or allowed types
   - Collapse into a final pixel value based on user rules
4. The result is a grayscale image that can be converted into a mesh or used directly in your pipeline.

## 🗂 YAML Example (Simplified)

```YAML
# TODO
````

> The algorithm continues recursively until the field's area is smaller than a pixel, or a leaf rule is reached.
